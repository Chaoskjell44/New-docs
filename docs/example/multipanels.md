Multi-panels are the combination of 2 or more Ticket Panels in a single embed:

### Creating A Multi-panel
---
In order to create a multi-panel, you'll need to head over to the web dashboard and select your server. If you're unfamiliar with how to do that, read our [guide on the web dashboard here](../setup/dashboard.md).

Once on your server's main settings page, select `Ticket Panels` in the navigation bar:

<img src="/example/panels_navbar.webp" alt="Ticket panel page" aling="middle"></img>

You'll want to focus on the *right* side of the screen. The left side are settings for individual panels (known as [Ticket Panels](../dashboard/reaction-panels.md).)

Draw your attention to the `New Multi-Panel` card. You'll configure the panel's appearance here:

### Panel Title
---
The panel title is the bold text at the _top_ of the embed.

i> The panel title has a maximum length of 255 characters, and by default, it is set to `Open a ticket!`.

### Panel Content
---
The panel content is the text in the long description of the embed. We recommend providing a general overview of how your support system works, such as which languages the support agents are fluent in.

i> The panel content has a maximum length of 1024 characters.

### Panel Colour
---
This is the colour on the left side of the embed. When clicked, a colour picker will open as shown below:

### Panel Channel
---
This is the channel that the multi-panel will be sent in for users to react to. Therefore, this channel should be accessible to your users, and be the only message in the channel to avoid confusion.

w> This should not be the same as your archive / transcript channel.

---
This input field is where you select which of your already made individual panels you'd like to include in the multi-panel.
